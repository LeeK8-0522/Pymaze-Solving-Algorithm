# Pymaze-Solving-Algorithm
with A* search algorithm and UCS algorithm

How to run?
1. Change directory to pymaze folder.
2. In command line (cmd), type 
"python -m tests.a_star_search_test"    (for testing a * search algorithm)
"python -m tests.a_star_search_special_version_test"    (for testing special version of a * search algorithm)
"python -m tests.uniform_cost_search_test"    (for testing uniform cost search algorithm)

If you run the code, it will show the animation of solving maze. 
Red colored cell means optimal path, and yellow colored cell means visited cell but not optimal.
